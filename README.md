## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS


### What I learned

I wanted to push my understanding of manipulating elements without using any frameworks. Turns out, as it always does, that I have much to learn. The experience has thought me greatly as I am not able to through a quick layout of the elements onto the screen. I will continue to push without any frameworks. 

### Continued development

- Using Semantic HTML
- Having a more conscise and modular CSS
- Refactoring more often
